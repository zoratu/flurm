\* TLC Configuration for FlurmJobLifecycle.tla
\* Run with: java -jar tla2tools.jar -config FlurmJobLifecycle.cfg FlurmJobLifecycle.tla

\* Specification to check
SPECIFICATION Spec

\* Constants - keep small for bounded model checking
CONSTANTS
    MaxJobs = 3
    MaxTimeLimit = 4

\* No symmetry needed - job IDs are ordered, time is ordered

\* Invariants to verify (safety properties)
INVARIANT TypeInvariant
INVARIANT TimeMonotonicity

\* State transition invariants (checked as action properties)
\* Note: TerminalStatesAbsorbing and OnlyValidTransitions are action properties
\* that are verified at each step, not as state invariants

\* For liveness checking, uncomment:
\* SPECIFICATION LivenessSpec
\* PROPERTY AllJobsTerminate
\* PROPERTY RunningJobsProgress
\* PROPERTY CompletingJobsFinish
\* PROPERTY SuspendedJobsProgress
\* PROPERTY TimeLimitsEnforced
